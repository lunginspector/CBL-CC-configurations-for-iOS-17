On iOS 17, changing the control center layout is possible with Cowabunga Lite. However, there are two problems. One, it only works on Macs, and two, there is a bug which moves the Screen Mirroring toggle to the middle, causing the rest of the layout to be pushed down. However, I have figured out how to fix both of these issues.

Tutorial (Windows Only):

Make sure you have Cowabunga Lite installed and your device is ready.
Open File Explorer and type in the directory “%APPDATA%/CowabungaLite/Workspace”
Locate the UDID of your device and click on the “SkipSetup” folder
Create a new folder called “HomeDomain” and open it.
Create a new folder called “Library” and open it.
Create a new folder called “ControlCenter” and open it.
Import the ModuleConfiguration file into the folder 
Open Cowabunga Lite, make sure “Skip Setup” is checked and click the “Apply” button.


And that’s all to it! You can move some of the modules around in Settings, but don’t delete anything that doesn’t have an icon next to the name.
